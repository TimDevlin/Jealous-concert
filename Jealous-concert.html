      <p>After months of agonizing delay, Frank Oceans second album <strong>Blonde</strong> is now
      availble on apple music<br />
      <q>Blonde opens with spellbinding first single Nikes, whose eccentrically grandiose
      video Ocean released Saturday morning. Addressing matters of class, materialism and
      passion through dreamy, distorted vocals, the song has the trademark vulnerability of
      Ocean's Channel Orange and Nostalgia, Ultra, while also moving him into more sonically
      adventurous territory.</q>
